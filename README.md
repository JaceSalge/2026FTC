# Hive Of Steel 9402 — FTC 2026

## B0B Codebase

Welcome to the official code repository for B0B, the 2026 robot built by Team 9402 — CyberSwarm. This is where the software that powers our robot lives — clear, efficient, and competition-ready.

## About the Project
This code controls everything from B0B’s drivetrain and arm mechanisms to autonomous navigation and sensor integration. Written in Java and rigorously tested, it reflects the skills, teamwork, and creativity we’ve developed throughout the season.

## About Me
I joined FTC to build my STEM skills. Along the way, I took on bigger roles — eventually becoming Head Coder and Assistant Captain. I learned Java from the ground up and led the effort to develop the systems that drive B0B today.

## Moving Forward
This repository represents not just a season’s worth of work, but a foundation for future teams. We aim to keep improving, innovating, and building on what we’ve started here.

# Let’s get to work.
