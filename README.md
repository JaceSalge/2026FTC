# 2025FTC
## Overview
The Java code for our FTC 2025 robot, B0B. We are 9402 (CyberSwarm), and our robot has shaped out nice.

## History
I joined FTC robotics for the STEM skills. I learned much more. But, rather than share my story, I'll just say I ultimately became the head coder and assistant captian. I had to learn java for this, and here is the fruits of my labor.
